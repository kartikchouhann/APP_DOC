Access and Permissions:

Ensure you have admin access to both the Bitbucket and GitHub repositories.
Confirm that the service account or user performing the migration has the necessary permissions to create repositories on GitHub.



 Confirm Bitbucket Repositories
The two repositories to be migrated from Bitbucket to GitHub have already been identified and are ready for migration:
Repository 1: [repo_name_1]
Repository 2: [repo_name_2]


Step 2: Import Repository to GitHub

Once the Bitbucket repository has been identified, the next step is to import it into GitHub. GitHub provides an "Import Repository" feature that simplifies the process of migrating repositories from other platforms.

Access the GitHub Import Tool:

Navigate to GitHub and create a new repository.
When prompted, select the option to import an existing repository.
Enter Bitbucket Repository Details:

Provide the Bitbucket repository URL (including credentials if necessary for private repositories).
Ensure that you are importing the repository into the correct organization or user account on GitHub.
Select Import Options:

GitHub will automatically import all the repository's commits, branches, and tags.
Review and confirm the details to ensure everything is set for import.
Monitor the Import Process:

The import may take a few minutes, depending on the repository's size.
Once complete, verify that all code, commit history, branches, and tags are intact.
Post-Import Validation:

After the import is finished, review the new GitHub repository to ensure all data has been migrated correctly.
Check if any additional settings, such as branch protections or integrations, need to be configured.
