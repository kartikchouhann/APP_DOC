Access and Permissions:

Ensure you have admin access to both the Bitbucket and GitHub repositories.
Confirm that the service account or user performing the migration has the necessary permissions to create repositories on GitHub.



 Confirm Bitbucket Repositories
The two repositories to be migrated from Bitbucket to GitHub have already been identified and are ready for migration:
Repository 1: [repo_name_1]
Repository 2: [repo_name_2]


1. Access the GitHub Import Tool:
Log in to your GitHub account.
Go to the GitHub Importer by navigating to this URL: GitHub Importer.
2. Enter Bitbucket Repository URL:
In the "Your old repository's clone URL" field, enter the HTTPS clone URL of your Bitbucket repository.
The format typically looks like this: https://bitbucket.org/<username>/<repository_name>.git
Example:
https://bitbucket.org/johndoe/my-repo.git
3. Select Your Repository Options:
Owner: Choose the owner of the new repository (your account or an organization).
Repository Name: Enter a name for the new GitHub repository. This can be the same as the Bitbucket repository name or a different one if desired.
Description: Add a brief description of the repository (optional).
Privacy Settings: Select whether the repository will be Public or Private based on your original Bitbucket settings.
4. Import the Repository:
Click on the Begin Import button.
GitHub will start importing the repository. This process may take some time, depending on the size of the repository.
5. Monitor the Import Process:
After initiating the import, you will be redirected to the new repository page. GitHub will show the progress of the import process.
Wait until the import completes successfully.
6. Verify Repository Contents:
Once the import is complete, check that all branches, commits, and tags have been migrated:
Navigate to the Branches and Commits sections to ensure everything is intact.
Review the README and other files to confirm the content is correct.
